## 🎯 **Assessment Overview**

This project implements a complete GitHub webhook monitoring system that captures and displays repository events in real-time. The implementation follows the exact assessment specifications with additional bonus features for enhanced functionality.

### **Key Features**
- ✅ **Real-time Webhook Processing** - Captures PUSH, PULL_REQUEST, and MERGE events
- ✅ **Professional UI** - Clean, minimal dashboard with 15-second polling
- ✅ **Two-Repository Architecture** - Separate action and webhook repositories
- ✅ **Production Deployment** - Live demo on Render platform
- ✅ **Bonus MERGE Events** - Extra brownie points implementation

## 🛠️ **Technologies Used**

For this GitHub webhook assessment, I used **Python Flask** as the main web framework to handle webhook endpoints and serve the dashboard. **PostgreSQL** was chosen as the database instead of MongoDB because it offers seamless integration with Render deployment platform, making production deployment much easier. The frontend uses **HTML5, CSS3, and vanilla JavaScript** for a clean, minimal UI with 15-second polling intervals. The project follows a **two-repository architecture** with action-repo (Node.js Express) for triggering webhooks and webhook-repo (Flask) containing the main application and UI. **Git/GitHub** handles version control, while **Render** provides reliable cloud hosting with PostgreSQL support.

## 🚀 **Live Demo**

**Dashboard URL**: https://github-webhook-dashboard.onrender.com/

The live demo showcases:
- Real-time webhook event processing
- Professional UI with GitHub-style design
- PostgreSQL database integration
- 15-second polling for live updates
- Support for PUSH, PULL_REQUEST, and MERGE events

## 📋 **Message Formats (Assessment Specification)**

### PUSH Events
**Format**: `"{author}" pushed to "{to_branch}" on {timestamp}`  
**Example**: `"ShreyaKumari13" pushed to "main" on 5th July 2025 - 2:30 PM UTC`

### PULL_REQUEST Events
**Format**: `"{author}" submitted a pull request from "{from_branch}" to "{to_branch}" on {timestamp}`  
**Example**: `"ShreyaKumari13" submitted a pull request from "feature-branch" to "main" on 5th July 2025 - 3:15 PM UTC`

### MERGE Events (Bonus)
**Format**: `"{author}" merged branch "{from_branch}" to "{to_branch}" on {timestamp}`  
**Example**: `"ShreyaKumari13" merged branch "feature-branch" to "main" on 5th July 2025 - 3:45 PM UTC`

## 🎯 **Repository Links**

### **action-repo** (Webhook Trigger)
- **Purpose**: Node.js Express application that generates webhook events
- **Repository**: [action-repo](./action-repo/)
- **Technology**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Function**: Triggers GitHub webhooks when repository actions occur

### **webhook-repo** (Webhook Receiver)
- **Purpose**: Flask application that receives and displays webhook events
- **Repository**: [webhook-repo](./webhook-repo/)
- **Technology**: Python, Flask, PostgreSQL
- **Function**: Processes webhooks and serves the dashboard UI

## 🔧 **Quick Start**

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- Node.js 16+
- PostgreSQL (for local development)
- Git

### Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ShreyaKumari13/Github-Webhook-Dashboard.git
   cd Github-Webhook-Dashboard
   ```

2. **Setup webhook-repo (Flask)**
   ```bash
   cd webhook-repo
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python app.py
   ```

3. **Setup action-repo (Node.js)**
   ```bash
   cd action-repo
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

4. **Configure GitHub Webhooks**
   - Go to repository Settings → Webhooks
   - Add webhook URL: `https://your-domain.com/webhook`
   - Select events: Pushes, Pull requests

## 📊 **Database Schema**

Events are stored in PostgreSQL with the assessment-specified structure:

```sql
CREATE TABLE webhook_events (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    request_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    author VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    action VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    from_branch VARCHAR(255),
    to_branch VARCHAR(255),
    timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    raw_payload JSONB,
    event_type VARCHAR(100)
);
```
